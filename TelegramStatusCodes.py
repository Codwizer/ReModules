Similar to <b>400 BAD_REQUESTS</b>, but the app must display the error to the user a bit differently.
Do not display any visible error to the user when receiving the <b>rpc_error</b> constructor: instead, wait for an <a href="https://core.telegram.org/constructor/updateServiceNotification ">updateServiceNotification</a> update, and handle it as usual.
Basically, an <a href="https://core.telegram.org/constructor/updateServiceNotification"updateServiceNotification</a> <b>pop-up</b> update will be emitted independently (ie NOT as an <a href="https://core.telegram.org/type/Updates">Updates</a> constructor inside <b>rpc_result</b> but as a normal update) immediately after emission of a 406 <b>rpc_error</b>: the update will contain the actual localized error message to show to the user with a UI popup.

An exception to this is the <b>AUTH_KEY_DUPLICATED</b> error, which is only emitted if any of the non-media DC detects that an authorized session is sending requests in parallel from two separate TCP connections, from the same or different IP addresses.
Note that parallel connections are still allowed and actually recommended for media DCs.
Also note that by session we mean a logged-in session identified by an <a href="https://core.telegram.org/constructor/authorization">authorization</a> constructor, fetchable using <a href="https://core.telegram.org/method/account.getAuthorizations">account.getAuthorizations</a>, not an MTProto session.

If the client receives an <b>AUTH_KEY_DUPLICATED</b> error, the session was already invalidated by the server and the user must generate a new auth key and login again.""",
